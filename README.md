# Structure-based computational scanning of chemical modification sites in biologics

Welcome to the GitHub repository dedicated to supporting the simulations for our recent manuscript on "Structure-based computational scanning of chemical modification sites in biologics". This repository contains all the necessary input files and resources required to replicate the computational workflow outlined in our study.

## Abstract:

In our manuscript, we explore the enhancement of peptide and protein-based drugs through fatty acid derivatizationâ€”a chemical modification that can extend drug half-life, minimize immunogenicity, and refine drug delivery and uptake. Traditional methods for creating these modified therapeutics are often labor-intensive and result in products that may be unstable, inactive, or heterogenous. To overcome these challenges, we have introduced a novel hybrid computational approach that leverages the Matcher protocol from the Rosetta suite and molecular dynamics simulations. This method is designed to streamline the synthesis of chemically modified biologics, allowing for the precise tuning of their properties.

The repository serves as a toolkit for researchers and scientists interested in applying our workflow to their own projects. By using the provided input files, users can embark on the journey of designing optimized peptide therapeutics with fatty acid modifications, as well as extend the methodology to a wide array of chemically modified drugs.

Within this repository, you will find:

`Matcher Protocol Inputs:` The starting configurations and parameters needed to run the Matcher protocol from the Rosetta suite.

`Molecular Dynamics Simulation Inputs:` Pre-configured files for initiating molecular dynamics simulations that complement the Matcher protocol outputs.

`Example Data:` Sample results from our internal projects demonstrating the successful application of our workflow.

We encourage you to explore the repository, utilize the resources provided, and contribute to the advancement of drug discovery through computational design. If you encounter any issues or have questions regarding the workflow, please feel free to open an issue or contact the repository maintainers.

Thank you for your interest in our work, and we look forward to seeing the innovative ways in which the scientific community will apply these tools to accelerate the development of new therapeutics.
